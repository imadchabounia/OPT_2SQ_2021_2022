[*] An heuristic for unbounded knapsack

Phase1 : Init solution

We use worth and we take as much as possible from each element, so we will pick m elements

Phase2 : We try to improve

Here we try to work on coefficients xi of each picked item and also left ones

for each element already picked, we try to decrease value of x and search for another element which can be a better fit while taking into consideration all elements but we don't change the rest, items with index > m
